# Snapshot Protocol Tools – TruthOrigin

**The definitive solution for SEO in WebAssembly, SPA, and decentralized environments.**

**The Snapshot Protocol** is a next-generation SEO and snapshot protocol built for the modern web, enabling **instant-loading**, **search engine–friendly**, and **social-media-aware** HTML snapshots for every route in your application. With a little side bonus of resolving Web3 relative path routing issues!

Designed specifically for **Single Page Applications (SPAs)** and **WebAssembly-based frontends**, TruthOrigin tools and protocol generates **pre-rendered static HTML** from your dynamic app, complete with accurate titles, descriptions, Open Graph tags, canonical URLs, structured data, and more.

## Built for Modern Frameworks & Platforms

The protocol works seamlessly with:

- **Blazor WebAssembly**
- **React / Next.js**
- **Angular / Vue**
- **Svelte / SolidJS**
- **IPFS, Filecoin, Web3 static hosting**
- Any static site using **client-side routing**

No hacks, no compromise.
Just structured HTML snapshots, generated locally, deployed anywhere.

## What It Solves

- **SEO Visibility** – Get every page indexed by Google and Bing, not just the root
- **Social Sharing** – Enable rich previews on Discord, Twitter, LinkedIn, Facebook
- **Web3 Compatible** – Fixes routing and 404s in IPFS/static-hosted apps
- **Performance** – Serve blazing-fast pre-rendered HTML before hydration kicks in

## How It Works

TruthOrigin tools is powered by the **Snapshot Protocol**, a hybrid tooling + structure system that:

1. Uses a simple `<snapshot-ready>` signal in your frontend app
2. Crawls your app’s sitemap or route list
3. Captures HTML snapshots when the app declares it's fully rendered
4. Saves the result into route-matching folder structures like:
```
/articles/my-article/index.html
```

No JavaScript execution required for bots.  
Every route becomes statically crawlable, indexable, and sharable — just like traditional SSR, but without the overhead.
